# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Rock paper scissors game is also known as stone paper scissors. It is a hand game that is usually played between 2 people, each player can randomly form any one of three from their hand.

A player who chooses rock will win by another player who chooses scissors but loose by the player who chooses paper; a player with paper will loose by the player with the scissors.

If both players choose the same then the game is tied. Rock paper scissors game is mainly played among kids.

The objective of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with a computer, anywhere, and anytime. This project is base on the rules that:

# Rock blunts Scissors so rock wins
# Scissors cut the Paper so scissors win
# Paper covers Rock so paper wins

## This project is build using tkinter, random modules, and the basic concept of python.

In this python project, players have to choose any one from rock, paper, and scissors. Then click on the play button will show the result of the game.

# Tkinter
A standard GUI library which is one of the easiest ways to build a GUI application.

# random 
Used to generate random numbers

Tk() use to initialized Tkinter to create window
geometry() sets the window width and height
resizable(0,0) by this command we can fix the size of the window
title() used to set the title of the window
bg = ‘’ use to set the color of the background

Label() widget used when we want to display text that users can’t modify.
root is the name of our window
text which displays on the label as the title of that label
font in which form the text is written
pack used to the organized widget in form of block

user_take is a string type variable that stores the choice that the user enters.
Entry() widget used when we want to create an input text field.

Button() widget used when we want to display a button.
command called the specific function when the button will be clicked.
root.mainloop() method executes when we run our program.

# Summary
we have successfully developed the rock-paper-scissors game using python. We used Tkinter library for rendering graphics. We use a random module to generate random choices. We learn how to create button widget. We also learn how to call the function using button. In this way, we created a rock-paper-scissors python game.
